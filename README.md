# 🪔 Diwali Sales Analysis (EDA using Python)

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a **Diwali sales dataset** to understand customer purchasing behaviour, identify top-performing segments, and derive insights that can help improve marketing and sales strategies during the festive season.

The analysis is done in a Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## 🎯 Objectives

The main goals of this analysis are to:

- Clean and preprocess the Diwali sales dataset.
- Understand customer demographics and purchasing patterns.
- Identify:
  - Top **age groups**, **genders**, and **marital status** contributing to sales.
  - Top **states** and **occupations** in terms of orders and revenue.
  - Best-selling **product categories** and **products**.
  - Derive **business insights** to help target the right customers with the right products.
